I'm currently working at Zitro as a QA Analyst.

I'm also studying Python development at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya and taking English classes to improve my skills.

I hold a **DAM (Advanced Technician in Multiplatform Applications Development)** degree. During my studies, I learned to program in **Java, HTML, XML, CSS, C#, MySQL, MongoDB and Python**. I'm probably missing some languages, but overall, I built a solid programming foundation.

My interest in Python grew after developing a small AI project for my final thesis. Now, I want to deepen my knowledge, strengthen my skills, and obtain a certification to validate my expertise.
